                SONDERNISTA is a photographic practice based in Ontario, Canada, 
                working across street photography, candid portraiture, and 
                documentation of the body modification subculture. The work 
                centers on invisibility—catching moments unseen by others, 
                finding connection through the lens. Projects are realized 
                across digital, 35mm film, and medium format.

                The name draws from <em>sonder</em>—the German word for "special," 
                and the realization that every passerby lives a life as vivid 
                as your own—and <em>nista</em>, from Old Norse, to pierce. The camera pierces moments 
                the way needles pierce flesh: deliberately, with purpose. The 
                work asks viewers to slow down, to let images unravel, to feel 
                what lies beneath the surface. In suspension photography, this 
                means finding peace beyond the apparent trauma. In portraiture, 
                sometimes the opposite.
