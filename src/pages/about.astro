                Sondernista is a fine art photographer exploring the intersection 
                of light, form, and quiet contemplation. Based between coasts, 
                the work draws from abandoned spaces, natural landscapes, and 
                the subtle poetry of everyday objects.

                The name derives from "sonder" — the realization that each 
                passerby has a life as vivid and complex as your own. This 
                awareness informs every image: a commitment to seeing deeply, 
                to honoring the overlooked, to finding the extraordinary 
                within the mundane.
              </p>

                Selected exhibitions include The Light Room (NYC), Format 
                Festival (UK), and PhotoVille Brooklyn. Work has been featured 
                in Aperture, FOAM Magazine, and The New York Times Magazine.
